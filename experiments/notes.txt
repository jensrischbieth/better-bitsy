ideas from reading ink docs
- syntax is more specialized and minimalist
	== headers ==
	-> goto_scene
	* choices
	{ conditions }
	newlines have meaning
	-> END dedicated end symbol
- special lists for cycles, random, etc
	{|||} sequence, {&|||} cycle, {!|||} once only, {~|||} shuffle (why not use commas?)
- global variables (instead of items?? where set them?)
	VAR variable = value
	~ means do numerical work on this line (not so sure about this symbol)
- choices can only be used once (not sure if that works for bitsy?)
- "" quotes for strings sometimes??? (what's the logic?)
- conditional choice
	* { condition } choice
- conditional text
	{ condition : the text }
- if/else block
	{
		- condition0 : 
			stuff
		- condition1 :
			other stuff
		- else :
			default stuff
	}
- idea: END of game vs END of dialog? (maybe use END vs STOP)
- what I like about INK
	- flexibility of global variables (vs items)
	- the way all section headers are automatically tracked as a variable
	- uncluttered syntax
- what I don't like about INK
	- gathers are confusing
	- in some ways it's not linear enough
